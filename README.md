// Created the different classes for the various team member roles that the user had the option of selecting
// Ensure that all tests pass
// Set up an empty array to store various employee objects and set up a function that would handle the inquirer CLI prompts
// Logic that prompts the user with a role specific question depending on role selection
// Depending on the role selected, the corresponding class will be applied to a new variable known as newMember which will create an object containing the three base properties/values and one role specific property/value
// The user then has the option to add more team members. If they choose to add more, the CLI will run the addMember() from the top. If not, the buildTeam() will build the team and write it to an HTML page.
